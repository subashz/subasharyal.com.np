Once upon a time, in a land filled with dreams and aspirations, there existed a mysterious figure who traversed the realms of slumber. This enigmatic being had the unique ability to enter the dreams of people and negotiate with them, urging them to embrace a grand vision for the future.

One day, this dreamwalker approached a group of influential individuals and proposed a plan that held the promise of greatness. "Invest more in your dreams," the figure urged, "for within them lies the key to unlocking a prosperous and powerful future."

The dreamwalker revealed a vision of transforming the nation into a global powerhouse, excelling in both firearms and luxury. The plan included investments in renewable energy, urban planning, and the development of specialized districts for various industries. The dreamwalker envisioned a futuristic landscape with cities tailored to specific expertise, much like Bangalore's tech hub.

"I can make you immortal," the figure declared, "and we will rule them all. Let's start anew, with a rebirth that propels us to greatness. Together, we shall make history that will never fade."

The dreamwalker emphasized the importance of secrecy and authority. "Grasp power secretly and rule authoritatively," the figure advised. "Become the city of temples, a beacon of progress. Your success should be massive, even if only visible in dreams. We will meet every three months, discussing new plans and strategies in the realm of dreams."

The dreamwalker outlined a plan to place a king in , leveraging the collective influence of the dreamers. "When the king wears the crown, congratulate and prepare for the right time. We must always remember that we need each other, our alliance bound by the dreams we share."

The dreamwalker's vision unfolded as the individuals embarked on a journey to explore and implement the plan. Each dream became a canvas for new possibilities, and as the dreamers shaped their visions, the nation started to transform.

In the waking world, the dreamers worked tirelessly, inspired by the shared dreams and the promise of immortality. The city of temples rose to prominence, and specialized districts flourished, turning dreams into reality. The once-sleeping nation awakened to a future of economic and sustainable development, becoming a force to be reckoned with on the global stage.

And so, in the quiet moments of slumber, the dreamers continued their discussions with the dreamwalker, ensuring that their shared dreams guided the nation's destiny for generations to come.
