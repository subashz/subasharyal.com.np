Dear Friend,

Shall I assign you a name, even though you exist solely within my thoughts?

This morning, I awoke at 8:30, later than my usual time. Have you ever wondered how one could deviate from their daily routine, skipping meditation and the gym? I found myself in that situation today, a consequence of my late-night slumber. This marks the second consecutive day that I've neglected my habits.

In the midst of my irregular morning, I indulged in a new Netflix series, "Blue Eye Samurai." I was captivated by its unique storyline and remarkable animation. What intrigued me most was the unexpected twist: the samurai protagonist was a woman. The series, set in the 17th century, skillfully portrayed the struggles faced by women, depicting them as mere tools for reproduction or objects to be sold. It is disheartening to contemplate the societal discrimination that prevailed during that era.

One can't help but long for advancements in technology, envisioning a future where mind-sharing technology renders verbal communication obsolete. Imagine a world where thoughts seamlessly translate into actions, executed precisely by robots and artificial intelligence. The integration of AI, along with innovations like stable diffusion and chat GPT, could revolutionize our lives, especially when combined with real-time visual feedback through camera technology. The prospect of witnessing such marvels, perhaps in a movie, fills me with anticipation.

In addition to "Blue Eye Samurai," I also completed the comedic series "Bojack Horseman." This show masterfully portrays the transformative impact of sobriety and life-altering experiences, emphasizing that life, akin to a miracle, offers no second chances. Even the strongest emotions cannot always overcome the barriers created by circumstances. It's not merely about physical intimacy; rather, it delves into the depths of emotions, compassion, and genuine passionâ€”themes that resonated deeply with me and served as valuable takeaways from the show.

I anticipate that today will be an extraordinary day, filled with excitement and promise. I eagerly look forward to what lies ahead.
