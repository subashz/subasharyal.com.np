With the blues and jazzy noon
We dreamt of making perfect app
For writer and novel galaxies

Fighting for the deadliness
Many nights of nothingness
Thirsting for the perfectness
Coined it the memosaa


We dreamt of making perfect app
Beholds our filthy animal heart
Reckoning the fame n dirty wealth
What if we at the everest peek ?
Thinkin about those toils n tears 
Pushing to unknown road 

Still, Drived past the road of development
Searching for the desire of accomplishment
Pain and vain bt still loved to relinquish
Still an app we love to cherish

Black n white like an yin and yang
Perfect combo of devil n angel
Buttery smooth at your finger tips
those pristine strokes of a character
May it be bitter or sweet taste writing
I chewed every bit of it 
Tasted the perfection that dreamt of
Love to cherish with broken hearts
Oh memosaa where u headin
Though I lovin like my god child
Shall I hate with sour heart

We dreamt of making perfect app
Pending drafts of poetry at shelf
Never to see the sun light day
Cloudy n stormy nights
Thinkin about u reaching the height
Is this a love or hate u may ask
What's ur side on my take
Now we are

Because of selfish wish
Still dreamt of making perfect app....
